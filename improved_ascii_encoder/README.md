# ASCII Encoder

The Improved ASCII Encoder by Don Lancaster was featured in the [February 1975 issue of the Radio Electronics magazine](improved_encoder_2_74.pdf). This encoder was a major improvement to the original "brute force" ASCII encoder that was featured in the April 1973 issue of Radio Electronics magazine.
