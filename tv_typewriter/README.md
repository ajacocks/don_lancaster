# TV Typewriter

Don Lancaster's TV Typewriter was featured in the [September 1973 issue of the Radio Electronics magazine](Radio-Electronics-1973-09.pdf). The article contained the first part of the TV Typewriter construction manual. The remaining parts were released in the [full version of the construction manual](TVTypewriterConstructionManual.pdf)

The TV Typewriter was introduced in the YouTube video titled [Building Don Lancaster's TV Typewriter](https://youtu.be/Z4RsOHaQ3xM) and built and tested in subsequent videos.

## PCB

The artwork in the construction manual was used to create PCBs of the TV Typewriter which contains 4 boards - 1 mainframe PCB, 1 cursor PCB, 1 timing PCB and 1 memory PCB (with the ability to expand to 2).

### Memory

The hardest to find components on the Memory board are the Signetics 2524V shift registers. The rest of the components are fairly easy to find. eBay is a good source for most of the components.

| IC8                  | 2518 MOS 32-bit recirculating shift register (Signetics)    | eBay, i.e. [this listing](https://www.ebay.com/itm/254053777558) |

### Timing

Most of the components on the Timing board are easy to find. The hardest part to find is the 4.261 MHz crystal oscillator.

| XTAL 1     | 4,561.920 KHz    | I used [4.5 MHz](https://www.ebay.com/itm/125806912675) for testing but a more precise frequency is required. You can try connecting the crystal and a trimmer capacitor in parallel to increase the frequency slightly (such as the 3-30 pF used on the Mainframe board). I will update this once I find a more suitable oscillator. |

## Issues

The first batch of PCBs had the following issues that needed correction:

1) The 5v voltage regulator footprint on the Mainframe was slightly too small. Correction: Drill out with 1/16" drill bit.
2) The RF tuner (trimmer capacitor) footprint on the Mainframe was too small. Correction: Use a drill to enlarge it slightly.
3) The coil footprint on the Mainframe was slightly too small. Correction: Use a drill bit large enough for the coil to enlarge it.
4) The power switch footprint on the Mainframe might be too small if using lower guage wire. Correction: Use 1/16" drill bit to enlarge it.
5) IC7 pin 12 of the Memory board has a short with a passing trace. Correction: Remove the short using a small knife or other method.
