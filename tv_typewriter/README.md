# TV Typewriter

Don Lancaster's TV Typewriter was featured in the [September 1973 issue of the Radio Electronics magazine](Radio-Electronics-1973-09.pdf). The article contained the first part of the TV Typewriter construction manual. The remaining parts were released in the [full version of the construction manual](TVTypewriterConstructionManual.pdf)

The TV Typewriter was introduced in the YouTube video titled [Building Don Lancaster's TV Typewriter](https://youtu.be/Z4RsOHaQ3xM) and built and tested in subsequent videos.

## PCB

The artwork in the construction manual was used to create PCBs of the TV Typewriter which contains 4 boards - 1 mainframe PCB, 1 cursor PCB, 1 timing PCB and 1 memory PCB (with the ability to expand to 2).
